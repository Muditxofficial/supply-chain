                            Certainly, supply chain logistics must run smoothly and efficiently enough to satisfy customers and suppliers.

They want to know where their orders are, how they are being fulfilled, and where the inventory is at each step of the lifecycle. Gaining and then sharing insight into each order and its associated item detail must happen in real time to appease customers, but doing so puts companies into binds when they don’t have such transparency themselves.
